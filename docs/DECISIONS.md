# Decision Log (ADR-lite)

Three lines per decision: **Decision / Why / Rejected.** This doc feeds the 25% "product judgment —
any wasted complexity?" score and the hiring track's "how they scoped and defended decisions."

---

### D-001 · Lemma is the entire backend
- **Decision:** Use Lemma Tables, Files, Agents, Workflows, Functions, App — no custom backend.
- **Why:** Lemma already provides them; rebuilding is wasted complexity (penalized) and costs SDK-utilisation points (15%).
- **Rejected:** FastAPI + Postgres + custom React. Reason: duplicates the platform we're graded on using.

### D-002 · No vector database
- **Decision:** Duplicate detection via `pod.files.search(search_method="HYBRID")`.
- **Why:** Files are auto-chunked + embedded; hybrid search is built in.
- **Rejected:** Qdrant / Pinecone / Weaviate / Milvus + embeddings pipeline. Reason: redundant, demo scale is ~20 issues not 10M vectors.

### D-003 · No Postgres / Redis of our own
- **Decision:** One `issues` Lemma Table; no cache layer.
- **Why:** Demo-scale data; Tables cover structured storage; no queue load to justify Redis.
- **Rejected:** 7-entity relational schema. Reason: hours of schema work that never appears on camera.

### D-004 · Read-only GitHub via PAT (no OAuth)
- **Decision:** Personal Access Token, read-only.
- **Why:** OAuth app registration + callbacks can eat half a day for zero demo value.
- **Rejected:** Full GitHub OAuth. GitHub is NOT a Lemma Surface, so this is the one connector we build.

### D-005 · Slack/Email via Surfaces or seed (not hand-built webhooks)
- **Decision:** Use Lemma Surfaces if time allows; otherwise seeded JSON into the same Table.
- **Why:** Surfaces include webhook ingress + identity resolution for free.
- **Rejected:** Hand-built FastAPI webhooks per source.

### D-006 · Evidence, not confidence percentages
- **Decision:** Investigation shows clickable evidence links, never a "91%" figure.
- **Why:** LLM-emitted percentages are uncalibrated theater; evidence is verifiable.
- **Rejected:** Confidence % UI from the original draft.

### D-007 · One persona, one hero loop
- **Decision:** Build for "Alex, founding engineer." Hero loop = ingest → triage+dedup → queue → investigate. Release Center is the only optional feature.
- **Why:** 35% problem-fit rewards a specific user; a working narrow loop beats five broken features.
- **Rejected:** Bug graph, analytics dashboard, command palette, multi-repo, CI/Sentry, breaking-change diff analysis.

### D-008 · Pin `lemma-sdk==0.5.0`; build against the introspected API
- **Decision:** Use the real `lemma-sdk` (import root `lemma_sdk`), pinned at 0.5.0; verified every call by introspecting the installed package, not by trusting the PRD's assumed syntax.
- **Why:** The PRD/contract had guessed env-var names (`LEMMA_POD_URL`/`LEMMA_API_KEY`) and a `files.write` that don't exist; building on guesses would fail at the live checkpoint. Ground-truth introspection is cheap insurance for the 15% SDK-utilisation score.
- **Rejected:** Coding against the PRD pseudocode as-is. Reason: wrong env vars, wrong file API, would silently break Day-1 integration.

### D-009 · `github_fetch` as a plain Python connector (not a deployed Lemma Function yet)
- **Decision:** Day 1 `github_fetch` is an importable Python module using `requests`; defer wrapping it as a deployed Lemma Function unless a workflow needs it server-side.
- **Why:** The connector logic is the work; it's testable without a pod and unblocks ingest immediately. GitHub is the one non-Surface source, so this is the only connector we own.
- **Rejected:** Standing up a deployed Lemma Function on Day 1. Reason: deployment overhead with no demo value yet.

### D-010 · Operator UI is a single-file HTML Lemma App (not Vite/React)
- **Decision:** Build `app/index.html` as a no-build HTML Lemma App (loads `lemma-client.js` from the host-injected `__LEMMA_CONFIG__`), with a `DataSource.listIssues()` seam that reads `seed/issues.json` in mock mode and `client.records.list("issues")` against the live pod.
- **Why:** The whole product is one operator console (queue → detail → investigate); HTML deploys with zero build and dodges the Windows/patched-CLI Vite build+deploy risk. The mock/live seam lets Lane B build full-speed against seed data with no dependency on Lane A — exactly the Day-1 parallelism the plan calls for.
- **Rejected:** Vite + React scaffold. Reason: routing/bundler overhead for a single-surface app, plus a heavier deploy path on Windows; revisit only if the UI genuinely needs client-side routing/state later.

### D-011 · D2+ agents/functions are bundle-authored (not SDK-scripted)
- **Decision:** Author the triage agent + `normalize_priority` function (and later the investigate workflow) as a **local pod bundle** (`pod/pod.json` + `pod/agents/*`, `pod/functions/*`) imported with `lemma pods import`, per the `lemma-builder` skill. The agent is a **read-only classifier** (POD toolset, granted `issues:read` + `/issues:read`, `output_schema` = `{priority, repro_steps, reason}`); `normalize_priority` is the validate-and-write step (coerce priority→enum, default `normal`, write back `status:'triaged'`); a Python SDK driver in `ingest/` orchestrates run→normalize→log over untriaged rows.
- **Why:** Agents are pod-resident config (instruction + toolsets + name-based grants), not Python objects — bundles make them versioned, diffable, and re-importable, and the skill is the authoritative guide. Keeping the agent read-only and pushing the write into a granted function keeps the LLM out of the data-integrity path (the 15% SDK-utilisation + 25% product-judgment scores reward this separation). D1's direct-SDK scripts stay for table/ingest plumbing — bundles are additive, not a rewrite.
- **Rejected:** Instantiating/agentic writes from a raw SDK script (no versioned agent resource, no grant boundary), and letting the agent write priorities directly (puts an LLM on the integrity path with no enum validation). The pod shell already exists, so `import` only upserts the new resources.

## Scope & kill criteria (Phase 0 agreement)
- **Lanes:** Dev A = Lemma Core (pod/agents/workflows/functions/ingest). Dev B = App & Demo (app/seed/recording/writeup).
- **Workflow:** trunk-based on `main`, conventional commits, one commit per checklist box, pull-before-push, folder ownership avoids conflicts.
- **Contract-first:** `docs/contracts.md` is frozen; build both lanes against it in parallel.
- **Kill criteria:**
  - Drop Release Center on **D4 AM** if investigation isn't solid.
  - Switch to **pre-recorded** investigation if live run is flaky by **D5 noon**.
  - Any task >2× its estimate → stop, sync, re-scope.

### Open decisions (TBD)
- Slack/Email: Surfaces vs seed — decide by end of D2.
- Release Center: go/no-go — decide D4 AM (record here).
