# Forge — Execution Framework & Mega Checklist
### Team of 2 · June 25–30, 2026 · one commit per ticked box

> How to read this:
> - **`[A]`** = Dev A (Lemma Core / backend). **`[B]`** = Dev B (App / Ingestion / Demo). **`[A+B]`** = sync, do together.
> - **🟢 PARALLEL** = A and B work at the same time, no blocking. **🔴 BLOCKING** = must finish before the dependent box starts.
> - **🔗 CONTRACT** = a shared interface; agree it together *before* splitting, then both build against it.
> - Each box ends with a suggested commit: `commit: \`type(scope): msg\``. Tick the box → make that commit → push. Small commits, often.

## PART 1 — The frameworks you're missing

You have a *product* plan (PRD.md). You're missing the *engineering process* that lets 2 people move fast without stepping on each other. These are the gaps to close in Phase 0, ranked by impact.

### 1. Contract-first development (THE thing that unblocks parallel work) 🔗
The reason 2 devs stall is waiting on each other. Kill that by **freezing the data contract on Day 1** and building against it:
- The `issues` Table schema (field names + types).
- The triage agent's **JSON output shape** (`{priority, repro_steps, related_ids}`).
- The investigation workflow's **result shape** (`{hypothesis, evidence:[{type,label,url}]}`).
Once these are agreed and committed, **B builds UI against mock data in that exact shape** while **A builds the real pod**. They meet at the contract. This is the single highest-leverage practice here.

### 2. Git workflow (so "one commit per box" actually works)
- **Trunk-based on `main`.** No long-lived branches for a 6-day, 2-person sprint — they diverge and merge-hell eats a day.
- **Folder ownership avoids conflicts:** A lives in `pod/` + `ingest/github`, B lives in `app/` + `seed/`. Different files = no conflicts.
- **Conventional commits:** `feat(pod): add issues table`, `fix(app): repro list overflow`, `chore: env example`. Scopes: `pod, app, agent, wf, fn, ingest, seed, docs, chore`.
- **Pull before you push. Push after every box.** Your work must survive a dead laptop — the repo is the backup.
- Optional: protect `main` only loosely; speed > ceremony here.

### 3. Secrets & env hygiene (a leaked key is a visible red flag to judges + hiring partners)
- `.env` is **git-ignored**; commit only `.env.example` with empty keys.
- Model API key + GitHub PAT live in env vars, never in code, never in a commit. Scan history before submitting.

### 4. Seed/mock data strategy (deterministic demos + B never blocked)
- A `seed/` folder of fixed JSON: ~20 GitHub-style issues (incl. 2–3 genuine duplicates), ~5 Slack msgs, ~3 emails, a few "merged PRs."
- The recording runs on this curated set so it's the same every take. Real GitHub fetch is shown live once; seed data carries the rest.

### 5. Vertical-slice / demo-driven development
Build the **thinnest end-to-end path first** (one issue → triaged → shown in UI), then deepen. Never spend 2 days on a component with no end-to-end path. At every EOD you should be able to *run the loop*.

### 6. A "run-it-all" smoke script + health check
- `scripts/smoke.*` that runs the core loop start→finish and prints PASS/FAIL.
- Run it before every demo take and before submitting. This is your "does the core loop work" insurance (25% of score).

### 7. Decision log — `DECISIONS.md` (ADR-lite)
Every scope cut and tech choice gets 3 lines: *decision / why / what we rejected.* This feeds two scored things directly: the **25% product-judgment** ("any wasted complexity?") and the **hiring track** ("how they scoped and defended decisions"). Your §8 cut-list from the PRD seeds it.

### 8. Daily cadence + integration checkpoints
- **AM (10 min):** what each of you ships today, where you'll integrate.
- **PM (the 🔁 checkpoints below):** merge both lanes, run the smoke script, fix integration breaks *same day*.

### 9. Time-boxing & kill criteria (decide the triggers NOW, not in the panic)
- Release Center is the **only** optional feature — drop it D4 AM if investigation isn't solid.
- If the live investigation is flaky by D5 noon → switch to the **pre-recorded** run (rules allow recordings).
- Any single task >2× its estimate → stop, ping teammate, re-scope.

### 10. README / runbook
A `README.md` that takes a stranger from clone → running in <10 steps. Needed for submission credibility *and* the Project Track (top-10 templates get published).

> Optional but nice: mirror this checklist into a **GitHub Projects board** (one card per box) so progress is visible and you can defend velocity in interviews.

## PART 2 — The mega checklist

### Lane ownership
- **Dev A — Lemma Core:** pod, Tables, Files, Agents, Workflows, Functions, dedup, GitHub fetch.
- **Dev B — App & Demo:** Lemma App UI, ingestion glue, seed data, demo recording, writeup, README.

### Repo layout (create in Phase 0)
```
forge/
  pod/        agents/  workflows/  functions/  tables/   # [A]
  app/                                                    # [B]
  ingest/     github/        # [A]      seed/ loader      # [B]
  seed/       *.json                                      # [B]
  scripts/    smoke.*                                     # [A+B]
  docs/       PRD.md  DECISIONS.md  EXECUTION.md  demo-script.md
  .env.example   README.md   .gitignore
```

---

## Parallelism cheat-sheet (who's blocked on whom)
- **Day 1:** fully parallel — B on mock data, A on real pod. Only the EOD checkpoint joins them.
- **Day 2–4:** A builds the brain (agents/workflow), B builds the face (UI) against the frozen contract. They integrate only at the 🔁 EOD checkpoint.
- **The contract is the seam.** As long as neither side changes a field name without telling the other (and updating `docs/contracts.md` + committing), you never block each other.
- **If A slips,** B keeps building against mock/seed data and demo polish — never idle.
- **If B slips,** A's loop still works via CLI; worst case the demo shows more CLI and less UI (still valid — polish is optional per rules).
