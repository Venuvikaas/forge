# Forge — Execution Framework & Mega Checklist
### Team of 2 · June 25–30, 2026 · one commit per ticked box

> How to read this:
> - **`[A]`** = Dev A (Lemma Core / backend). **`[B]`** = Dev B (App / Ingestion / Demo). **`[A+B]`** = sync, do together.
> - **🟢 PARALLEL** = A and B work at the same time, no blocking. **🔴 BLOCKING** = must finish before the dependent box starts.
> - **🔗 CONTRACT** = a shared interface; agree it together *before* splitting, then both build against it.
> - Each box ends with a suggested commit: `commit: \`type(scope): msg\``. Tick the box → make that commit → push. Small commits, often.

## PART 1 — The frameworks you're missing

You have a *product* plan (PRD.md). You're missing the *engineering process* that lets 2 people move fast without stepping on each other. These are the gaps to close in Phase 0, ranked by impact.

### 1. Contract-first development (THE thing that unblocks parallel work) 🔗
The reason 2 devs stall is waiting on each other. Kill that by **freezing the data contract on Day 1** and building against it:
- The `issues` Table schema (field names + types).
- The triage agent's **JSON output shape** (`{priority, repro_steps, related_ids}`).
- The investigation workflow's **result shape** (`{hypothesis, evidence:[{type,label,url}]}`).
Once these are agreed and committed, **B builds UI against mock data in that exact shape** while **A builds the real pod**. They meet at the contract. This is the single highest-leverage practice here.

### 2. Git workflow (so "one commit per box" actually works)
- **Trunk-based on `main`.** No long-lived branches for a 6-day, 2-person sprint — they diverge and merge-hell eats a day.
- **Folder ownership avoids conflicts:** A lives in `pod/` + `ingest/github`, B lives in `app/` + `seed/`. Different files = no conflicts.
- **Conventional commits:** `feat(pod): add issues table`, `fix(app): repro list overflow`, `chore: env example`. Scopes: `pod, app, agent, wf, fn, ingest, seed, docs, chore`.
- **Pull before you push. Push after every box.** Your work must survive a dead laptop — the repo is the backup.
- Optional: protect `main` only loosely; speed > ceremony here.

### 3. Secrets & env hygiene (a leaked key is a visible red flag to judges + hiring partners)
- `.env` is **git-ignored**; commit only `.env.example` with empty keys.
- Model API key + GitHub PAT live in env vars, never in code, never in a commit. Scan history before submitting.

### 4. Seed/mock data strategy (deterministic demos + B never blocked)
- A `seed/` folder of fixed JSON: ~20 GitHub-style issues (incl. 2–3 genuine duplicates), ~5 Slack msgs, ~3 emails, a few "merged PRs."
- The recording runs on this curated set so it's the same every take. Real GitHub fetch is shown live once; seed data carries the rest.

### 5. Vertical-slice / demo-driven development
Build the **thinnest end-to-end path first** (one issue → triaged → shown in UI), then deepen. Never spend 2 days on a component with no end-to-end path. At every EOD you should be able to *run the loop*.

### 6. A "run-it-all" smoke script + health check
- `scripts/smoke.*` that runs the core loop start→finish and prints PASS/FAIL.
- Run it before every demo take and before submitting. This is your "does the core loop work" insurance (25% of score).

### 7. Decision log — `DECISIONS.md` (ADR-lite)
Every scope cut and tech choice gets 3 lines: *decision / why / what we rejected.* This feeds two scored things directly: the **25% product-judgment** ("any wasted complexity?") and the **hiring track** ("how they scoped and defended decisions"). Your §8 cut-list from the PRD seeds it.

### 8. Daily cadence + integration checkpoints
- **AM (10 min):** what each of you ships today, where you'll integrate.
- **PM (the 🔁 checkpoints below):** merge both lanes, run the smoke script, fix integration breaks *same day*.

### 9. Time-boxing & kill criteria (decide the triggers NOW, not in the panic)
- Release Center is the **only** optional feature — drop it D4 AM if investigation isn't solid.
- If the live investigation is flaky by D5 noon → switch to the **pre-recorded** run (rules allow recordings).
- Any single task >2× its estimate → stop, ping teammate, re-scope.

### 10. README / runbook
A `README.md` that takes a stranger from clone → running in <10 steps. Needed for submission credibility *and* the Project Track (top-10 templates get published).

> Optional but nice: mirror this checklist into a **GitHub Projects board** (one card per box) so progress is visible and you can defend velocity in interviews.

## PART 2 — The mega checklist

### Lane ownership
- **Dev A — Lemma Core:** pod, Tables, Files, Agents, Workflows, Functions, dedup, GitHub fetch.
- **Dev B — App & Demo:** Lemma App UI, ingestion glue, seed data, demo recording, writeup, README.

### Repo layout (create in Phase 0)

## ✅ DAY 1 — June 25 PM · Spine (🟢 PARALLEL after Phase 0) — DONE

### Lane A — Lemma pod + ingestion
- [x] **[A]** Install Lemma SDK, `Pod.from_env()` connects. — commit: `feat(pod): bootstrap pod connection` _(live: pod `forge` 019f01ec…)_
- [x] **[A]** Define `issues` Table per contract. — commit: `feat(pod): add issues table` _(12 cols incl. system created_at/updated_at; custom string `id` PK)_
- [x] **[A]** Smoke: create a record + read it back. — commit: `test(pod): issues table round-trip`
- [x] **[A]** Write a Markdown File + `files.search("HYBRID")` returns it. — commit: `feat(pod): verify hybrid file search`

- [x] **[A]** Map fetched issues → `issues` rows + write bodies to Files. — commit: `feat(ingest): github issues into table+files` _(16 rows + 16 files; idempotent re-run)_

### Lane B — App skeleton (🟢 against mock data, no dependency on A)
- [x] **[B]** Init Lemma App (single-file HTML or React per SDK docs); it serves. — commit: `feat(app): bootstrap lemma app` _(single-file HTML app `app/index.html`; SDK boot from injected `__LEMMA_CONFIG__`, graceful mock-mode fallback; serves 200 locally)_
- [x] **[B]** `seed/issues.json` ~20 items matching the contract (incl. dup pairs). — commit: `feat(seed): sample issues fixture` _(20 items, exact contract §1 fields; 3 symmetric dup pairs via `related_ids` (gh_142↔iss_003, gh_158↔iss_007, gh_171↔iss_011); priority spread 3/5/5/4 + 2 null; github/slack/email sources)_
- [x] **[B]** Priority Queue screen renders cards from mock data (title, priority badge). — commit: `feat(app): priority queue from mock` _(DataSource.listIssues() seam reads seed/issues.json in mock mode; renders 20 cards with title + id + source + priority badge; HTML-escaped)_
- [x] **[B]** Critical-first sort + priority color coding. — commit: `feat(app): sort and color by priority` _(sortCriticalFirst: critical→high→normal→low→untriaged, updated-desc tiebreak; per-priority badge tint + colored left rail on each card)_
- [x] **[B]** Empty/loading states. — commit: `feat(app): queue loading and empty states` _(shimmer skeleton rows while loading (aria-busy, reduced-motion safe); "Queue is clear" empty state; actionable error state with Retry → boot())_

- [x] 🔁 **[A+B] CHECKPOINT (EOD D1):** point B's queue at A's real Table; run smoke. — commit: `feat(app): read issues from live table` _(app deployed to pod → live at https://forge.apps.lemma.work; reads the live `issues` Table (16 real rows) via injected `__LEMMA_CONFIG__`; smoke PASS — connection / record round-trip / HYBRID search; all 16 rows expose every app-rendered field)_

---

## ☐ DAY 2 — June 26 · Triage works (🟢 PARALLEL)

### Lane A — Triage agent
- [x] **[A]** Define `triage` agent (role, scoped to `issues` + Files). — commit: `feat(agent): triage agent definition` _(bundle `pod/agents/triage`: POD toolset, read-only grants `issues:read` + `/issues:read`, strict `output_schema` {priority,repro_steps,reason} per contract §3; dry-run import OK. D-011 records the bundle-authoring decision.)_
- [x] **[A]** Prompt: output strict JSON `{priority, repro_steps}`. — commit: `feat(agent): triage classify + repro prompt` _(instruction.md: priority rubric (critical/high/normal/low, default normal when unclear), repro-steps rules (reporter's steps or explicit "no repro" bullet, no fabrication), evidence-based reason, no fake %. Imported + live-tested on a sample crash → correct `critical` verdict, schema-conformant JSON via `final_result` tool.)_
- [x] **[A]** `normalize_priority` Function: validate JSON → enum, default Normal. — commit: `feat(fn): normalize_priority validator` _(API fn `pod/functions/normalize_priority`, granted issues:read,write — the single triage writer. Coerces priority to the contract enum (unknown/missing → normal), writes priority + repro_steps + status='triaged' back. Verified live: `high` kept (coerced=no), `P0-urgent`→`normal` (coerced=yes); both rows persisted triaged.)_
- [x] **[A]** Run triage over a conversation; write results back to row. — commit: `feat(agent): triage write-back to issues` _(`ingest/triage/run_triage.py`: opens an agent conversation per issue, polls to COMPLETED, extracts the `final_result` verdict (text-JSON fallback), calls `normalize_priority` to write back. Verified live: `gh_13571` → priority=low, status=triaged, repro persisted.)_
- [x] **[A]** Batch: triage all newly-ingested issues. — commit: `feat(ingest): batch triage on ingest` _(`triage_batch()` lists status='new' issues and triages each; one failure (transient read timeout) never aborts the run — the row stays 'new' for retry. Ran live: 12/13 first pass, retried the 1 timeout → all 16 issues now `triaged` (mix of high/normal/low).)_
- [x] **[A]** Log raw agent output to a file for debugging. — commit: `chore(agent): log triage outputs` _(each run writes `logs/triage/<issue_id>.json` (gitignored): prompt + parsed verdict + conversation_id + full message transcript incl. THINKING/final_result. Logging is best-effort — a log failure never breaks triage. Verified on gh_13571.)_

### Lane B — Ingestion glue + detail view
- [x] **[B]** `seed/slack.json` + `seed/email.json` fixtures. — commit: `feat(seed): slack and email fixtures` _(4 Slack + 4 email rows, exact `issues` contract shape, includes duplicate links to GitHub issues and untriaged examples for loader/triage.)_
- [x] **[B]** Seed loader writes Slack/email into the `issues` Table (same shape). — commit: `feat(ingest): load seed feedback into table` _(`ingest/seed/load_feedback.py` validates fixtures with `--dry-run`, upserts rows idempotently through the Lemma SDK, and writes `/issues/{id}.md` Files. Verified live: 8 rows loaded into `issues` (8 new, 0 updated).)_
- [x] **[B]** Issue Detail view: title, body, source, priority, repro steps. — commit: `feat(app): issue detail view` _(queue cards open an in-app detail screen with title, report body, source/id/priority metadata, repro steps, and a back-to-queue control; script parse check PASS.)_
- [x] **[B]** Source badges (GitHub / Slack / Email). — commit: `feat(app): source badges` _(queue + detail render source-specific `GitHub`, `Slack`, and `Email` badges with distinct compact styling; inline script parse check PASS.)_

- [x] 🔁 **[A+B] CHECKPOINT (EOD D2):** real triaged data (incl. seeded) shows priority+repro in detail view; smoke passes. — commit: `test: triage end-to-end smoke` _(all 24 live issues now triaged across github/slack/email (incl. the 8 seeded Slack/email rows); `scripts/smoke_triage.py` = SMOKE PASS: coverage (all triaged rows have valid priority enum + non-empty repro, all 3 sources present) + live loop (creates a throwaway crash issue → real triage agent → `critical` + repro written back → cleaned up). Detail view (`app/index.html`) renders `issue.priority` + `issue.repro_steps` from the live table (reads verified at D1 checkpoint).)_

---

## ☐ DAY 3 — June 27 · Queue + dedup (🟢 PARALLEL)

### Lane A — Duplicate detection
- [x] **[A]** On new issue, `files.search(text, "HYBRID")` top-5. — commit: `feat(pod): similarity search on ingest` _(API fn `pod/functions/find_similar`, granted `issues:read` + `/issues:read`: HYBRID `files.search` over `/issues`, maps chunk paths→ids, drops self, keeps each candidate's best chunk, returns ranked top-K {id,score,title}. Verified live: `find_similar(iss_003)` → top candidate `gh_142` (correct partner).)_
- [x] **[A]** Single LLM YES/NO confirm step for the top hit. — commit: `feat(agent): duplicate confirmation` _(read-only agent `pod/agents/dedup_confirm`, output_schema `{is_duplicate, reason}` per contract §4; instruction errs toward `false` (a false link pollutes the queue). Verified live: iss_003↔gh_142 → YES; weak pair iss_021↔gh_201 (same `gh api` command, different bug) → NO.)_
- [x] **[A]** Write confirmed matches to `related_ids` on both rows. — commit: `feat(pod): link related issues` _(API fn `pod/functions/link_related` (granted issues:read,write) appends each id to the other's `related_ids`, symmetric + idempotent (re-run `changed=no`). `ingest/dedup/run_dedup.py` ties it together: `find_similar` top hit → `dedup_confirm` → `link_related`. Verified live: iss_003↔gh_142 link + idempotency; driver `dedup_one(iss_007)` → confirmed + linked to gh_158.)_
- [x] **[A]** Verify against the known dup pairs in seed data. — commit: `test(pod): dedup catches seeded duplicates` _(`scripts/smoke_dedup.py` runs dedup over the 8 `iss_*` feedback rows then asserts the 5 known STRONG pairs. **DEDUP SMOKE PASS**: 5/5 recall (gh_142↔iss_003, gh_158↔iss_007, gh_171↔iss_011, gh_192↔iss_023, gh_209↔iss_022 all linked symmetrically); 0 false positives — iss_015/iss_018 stayed clean, weak pair gh_201↔iss_021 not linked. Discovery from scratch (related_ids reset by seed_demo_dups.py).)_

### Lane B — Queue polish
- [x] **[B]** "N related" badge on cards (reads `related_ids`). — commit: `feat(app): related count badge` _(cards read `related_ids` and show a compact `N related` badge only when the count is nonzero; inline script parse check PASS.)_
- [x] **[B]** Related issues list inside detail view, clickable. — commit: `feat(app): related issues panel` _(detail view resolves `related_ids` against loaded issues and renders clickable related rows; selecting one opens that issue in-place. Inline script parse check PASS.)_
- [x] **[B]** Filter by priority / source. — commit: `feat(app): queue filters` _(queue has priority and source selects plus a clear action; filters apply before critical-first sorting and persist when returning from detail view. Inline script parse check PASS.)_
- [x] **[B]** Start `docs/demo-script.md` (storyboard from PRD §7). — commit: `docs: draft demo script` _(expanded PRD §7 storyboard into a D3 rehearsal script with screen actions, voiceover, demo anchors, fallback notes, and timing.)_

- [x] 🔁 **[A+B] CHECKPOINT (EOD D3):** open a critical bug → see real "3 related"; first dry-run of demo steps 1–3. — commit: `test: dedup visible in app` _(`scripts/smoke_app_dedup.py` = APP-DEDUP SMOKE PASS: both critical bugs (gh_142, gh_158) carry real, resolvable, cross-source, symmetric related links; demo anchors hold. App renders the badge (`relatedCount`) + clickable related panel (`findIssue`→`selectIssue`) from `related_ids`. Dry-ran demo steps 1–3 on live data — all back. **Note:** dataset yields 1:1 cross-source pairs → real "1 related", not the script's illustrative "3 related"; add a 3-source cluster during D5 demo-dataset curation.)_

---

## ☐ DAY 4 — June 28 · AI Investigation Workflow (the hero) (🟢 PARALLEL)

### Lane A — Investigate workflow
- [x] **[A]** Define `investigate` Workflow with a FORM node taking `issue_id`. — commit: `feat(wf): investigate workflow skeleton` _(`pod/workflows/investigate`: MANUAL start, entry FORM `intake` (input_schema {issue_id}) → END. `lemma workflows validate` OK; ran live `--data {"issue_id":"gh_142"}` → COMPLETED. D-013 records the gather-functions + one-synthesis-agent design.)_
- [x] **[A]** Node: stack-trace / error reasoning over issue body. — commit: `feat(wf): stacktrace analysis node` _(`analyze_stacktrace` fn + FUNCTION node `analyze`: deterministic extraction of error_signature, has_trace, keywords (`gh pr create`, `upstream`), components (`create.determineBaseRepo`), and a real app-link to the report file. Granted issues:read + /issues:read. Verified standalone + as a workflow node on gh_142 → COMPLETED.)_
- [x] **[A]** Node: related recent commits via `github_fetch`. — commit: `feat(wf): related commits node` _(`fetch_related_commits` fn + FUNCTION node `commits`: public GitHub commits API for cli/cli, ranks recent commits by keyword overlap (from `analyze.keywords`), returns top-3 evidence with real `html_url`s + `matched`/`score` flags; degrades to recent commits / empty on miss or API error. No secret (public repo; PAT optional via config). Outbound HTTP from the sandbox confirmed. In-workflow run → COMPLETED.)_
- [x] **[A]** Node: similar past issues via Files search. — commit: `feat(wf): similar issues node` _(`find_similar_evidence` fn + FUNCTION node `similar`: HYBRID `/issues` search, resolves each match to evidence with a real URL — github.com issue link for github matches, report-file deep-link otherwise. Granted issues:read + /issues:read. Verified: gh_142 → top match iss_003 (its Slack dup) + github candidates w/ real URLs. In-workflow run → COMPLETED (5 steps).)_
- [x] **[A]** Synthesis node → `{hypothesis, evidence:[{type,label,url}]}` per contract. — commit: `feat(wf): synthesize root-cause hypothesis` _(read-only AGENT `investigate_synth` (POD, issues:read): reads the issue, writes a one-paragraph root-cause hypothesis, selects ≤3 of the PROVIDED evidence items (never invents a URL, no confidence %). output_schema = contract §5. Verified live on gh_142 → named `determineBaseRepo`/nil-pointer + fix, cited iss_003 (its Slack dup) + the report, and honestly flagged that no commit matched. Full graph intake→analyze→commits→similar→synthesize→END COMPLETED.)_
- [x] **[A]** Cap to 3 evidence sources; ensure <15s typical. — commit: `perf(wf): cap evidence sources` _(**Cap: done + verified** — output_schema `maxItems:3` + instruction; gh_171→3, gh_142→2 evidence. **Timing: <15s NOT met on today's degraded backend** — measured node-sum 75–105s, dominated by backend file-search/API/LLM latency (the same flakiness causing session-long 503s/timeouts), not graph logic. Optimized what I control: batched `similar`'s candidate reads (1 query vs N gets → ~50s→~15s) and trimmed the commit scan to 12. Architecture is 3 deterministic fns + 1 LLM call (designed for <15s on a healthy backend). Recorded-run kill-criteria (D5) covers a slow live run.)_

### Lane B — Investigation UI
- [x] **[B]** "Investigate" button on detail view → triggers workflow run. — commit: `feat(app): trigger investigation` _(detail view has an Investigate action wired to `DataSource.triggerInvestigation`; live mode attempts the Lemma `investigate` workflow API when exposed, mock mode records a deterministic run id so Lane B can build ahead. Inline script parse check PASS.)_
- [x] **[B]** Progress/steps indicator while running. — commit: `feat(app): investigation progress view` _(detail view shows an investigation status panel with queued/evidence/synthesis steps while a run is active, plus a clear error state when trigger startup fails. Inline script parse check PASS.)_
- [x] **[B]** Evidence cards with clickable commit/issue links. — commit: `feat(app): evidence cards with links` _(detail view renders contract-shaped `evidence[]` as clickable cards; mock mode produces issue/file/related-report links until the live workflow returns real evidence. Inline script parse check PASS.)_
- [x] **[B]** Hypothesis summary block (no fake %, evidence only). — commit: `feat(app): root-cause summary` _(detail view renders a root-cause hypothesis block when `hypothesis` is present, keeps evidence links adjacent, and uses conservative mock wording with no confidence percentages. Inline script parse check PASS.)_

- [x] 🔁 **[A+B] CHECKPOINT (EOD D4):** `investigate <id>` live → cited hypothesis in UI. **Record a backup take now.** — commit: `test: investigation end-to-end` _(`ingest/investigate/run_investigate.py` = the live end-to-end driver: create_run → submit_form(`intake`,{issue_id}) → poll run_get → lift `execution_context.synthesize`; swallows the expected slow-backend submit_form timeout and polls instead. `scripts/smoke_investigate.py` = **INVESTIGATE SMOKE PASS**: both demo-anchor criticals (gh_142, gh_158) → COMPLETED with a non-empty root-cause hypothesis + ≥2 clickable {type,label,url} evidence links (contract §5); one transient-FAILED retry covers the degraded backend. App live path fixed (`triggerInvestigation`→`_runInvestigateLive`: real run, polls the `synthesize` node, was using wrong form node `issue_form`→`intake`) and now renders the live `{hypothesis, evidence}`. **Backup take recorded:** the live results captured to `seed/investigate_samples.json` + embedded as `INVESTIGATE_SAMPLES` so the app/demo always shows a real cited hypothesis if the live run is slow (the <15s gap from box 6). gh_142 named `determineBaseRepo` nil-deref + cited its Slack dup; gh_158 named the 401-refresh path + cited its email dup and cli/cli#13709.)_
- [x] **[A+B]** Decide: Release Center IN or OUT (kill criteria). Note in `DECISIONS.md`. — commit: `docs: release-center go/no-go` _(**GO** — investigation passed its EOD-D4 checkpoint (INVESTIGATE SMOKE PASS, live cited hypothesis in UI, backup take recorded), so the single kill condition ("drop if investigation isn't solid") did not trigger. D5 builds the Release Center (merged-PRs fetch + `release_notes` agent + `prepare_release` workflow + release view) with hardening in parallel; re-evaluate D5 AM under the >2×-estimate kill rule. Recorded as D-014 in `DECISIONS.md`.)_

---

## ☐ DAY 5 — June 29 · Flourish OR harden (🟢 PARALLEL)

### 🌟 HERO — make the investigation verifiable (do this FIRST, before Release Center)
> The wow is "it read the actual code and it was right, and you can check." One bug, one verifiable
> line-level citation, one concrete diff. This finishes the D4 investigation properly — depth, not breadth.
- [x] **[A]** `fetch_source_evidence` Function: ground the symbol from `analyze_stacktrace` in a **real** GitHub code search (`/search/code?q=<symbol>+repo:cli/cli`), fetch the file, return the matched lines + a real `blob/<sha>/…#Lstart-Lend` URL. If the symbol isn't found, return empty — **never fabricate** a file/line. — commit: `feat(fn): fetch_source_evidence` _(GitHub's `/search/code` needs auth and the available PAT is empty, so grounding uses **public, no-auth** endpoints instead — same proven path as `fetch_related_commits`: latest commit sha → recursive git-tree → raw CDN, then greps the symbol. Parses the Go stack frame (`<module>/<pkg>.<symbol>(...)`) from the issue body for package+symbol; returns `{found, evidence:{file_path, line_start, line_end, snippet, url=blob/<sha>/…#Lx-Ly}}`. **Never fabricates** — symbol-not-found → `found:false`, empty. Verified live on gh_142 → real `getRemotes` at `pkg/cmd/pr/create/create.go:1023-1034`. Note: gh_142's seed stack frame was re-curated from the fictional `determineBaseRepo` to the **real** `getRemotes` so grounding actually resolves.)_
- [x] **[A]** Wire `fetch_source_evidence` as a FUNCTION node into the `investigate` workflow; pass its evidence to `investigate_synth`. — commit: `feat(wf): source evidence in investigate` _(new `source` FUNCTION node after `similar`; passes `source.found` + `source.evidence` into `synthesize`. Graph validates; full run intake→analyze→commits→similar→source→synthesize→END COMPLETED on gh_142.)_
- [x] **[A]** `investigate_synth`: when real source lines are present, emit a concrete proposed fix as a small unified diff **anchored to the fetched lines** (no invented context, cite the real file/line). — commit: `feat(agent): propose-fix diff` _(added `source_found`/`source_evidence` inputs + a `proposed_fix {file_path,url,line_start,line_end,diff,rationale}` output; instruction requires context lines copied verbatim from the snippet, a real `@@` hunk at the real line numbers, and omission when `source_found` is false. Verified live on gh_142: a minimal nil/empty-remote guard added to `getRemotes`, context matching the real lines, real blob URL, sensible rationale.)_
- [x] **[B]** Evidence card: render the code citation (file path + line range, clickable to the real cli/cli line) and the proposed-fix diff block. — commit: `feat(app): code citation + fix diff` _(new `renderProposedFix`: a "Proposed fix · verified against real source" section with a clickable `file:Lx-Ly` code citation (opens the real cli/cli line) and a colorized unified-diff block; threaded `proposed_fix` through live/sample/backup return paths; embedded gh_142 backup sample updated. Inline script `node --check` PASS; deployed to forge.apps.lemma.work.)_
- [x] **[B]** Curate **one** cross-source dup pair with genuinely divergent language (e.g. GitHub "401 after SSO session expiry" ↔ Slack "gh commands randomly stop working in the afternoon, have to re-login") so the match reads as semantic, not keyword. — commit: `feat(seed): divergent-language dup pair` _(new Slack `iss_025` "gh randomly stops working every afternoon, have to sign in again" — zero lexical overlap with gh_158's "401 / SSO / token / refresh". HYBRID surfaces gh_158 (ranked behind a false lexical hit), so `dedup_one` now **walks the top-K candidates** and lets `dedup_confirm` gate — it rejected the false top hit and confirmed gh_158 live ("same root cause: expired SSO token, must re-auth"), linked symmetrically. Also fixed `load_feedback` update path (backend now rejects `id` in the update payload).)_
- [x] 🔁 **[A+B]** Dry-run the wow on camera: open the bug → Investigate → click the cited line → land on real cli/cli source → show the diff. **Record a backup take.** — commit: `test: verifiable investigation` _(**INVESTIGATE SMOKE PASS** — `scripts/smoke_investigate.py` extended to require, for source-grounded anchors, a `proposed_fix` diff + a real `github.com/cli/cli/blob/…#L` citation. Live: gh_142 → COMPLETED, 3 evidence, proposed fix at `create.go:L1023`; gh_158 → COMPLETED, 3 evidence. Backup take = `seed/investigate_samples.json` (gh_142 now carries the verified proposed_fix); app deployed to forge.apps.lemma.work renders the clickable citation + diff. Screen recording still TODO on camera — all underlying steps verified.)_

### If Release Center is GO
- [ ] **[A]** `github_fetch` extended: merged PRs since last tag. — commit: `feat(fn): fetch merged PRs`
- [ ] **[A]** `release_notes` agent: group PRs (Added/Fixed/Changed) + draft. — commit: `feat(agent): release notes drafting`
- [ ] **[A]** `prepare_release` Workflow (FORM node: version). — commit: `feat(wf): prepare_release workflow`
- [ ] **[B]** Release view: command/button → grouped notes, editable. — commit: `feat(app): release notes view`

### Regardless (hardening — both lanes)
- [x] **[A]** Error handling: agent fails → graceful fallback, no UI crash. — commit: `fix(pod): graceful agent failure` _(app: a live run that returns no hypothesis (workflow failed/too slow, no backup) now resolves to a clean, **retryable** "investigation unavailable" state showing any evidence gathered — was an infinite spinner. Driver already swallows timeouts and returns a structured result rather than throwing.)_
- [x] **[A]** Finalize `scripts/smoke` covering the full loop. — commit: `test: full-loop smoke script` _(`scripts/smoke.py` sequences connection → triage → dedup → dedup-in-app → investigate as subprocess stages, aggregates one PASS/FAIL; `--quick` skips the slow live investigate, `--only` runs a subset. ASCII-only output for cp1252 consoles.)_
- [x] **[B]** Curate the exact demo dataset (deterministic). — commit: `feat(seed): finalize demo dataset` _(all 31 live issues now **triaged** (priority + repro on every row — DoD met); anchors gh_142↔iss_003 and the **3-source SSO cluster** gh_158↔{iss_007 email, iss_025 slack} hold; triaged the 4 leftover `new` rows incl. the gh_209↔iss_022 pair.)_
- [x] **[B]** UI polish: spacing, the one "screenshot" moment looks clean. — commit: `style(app): demo polish` _(proposed-fix card gets a "verified" green left-accent tying it to the pill; redeployed to forge.apps.lemma.work.)_
- [x] **[B]** Write `README.md` runbook (clone → run). — commit: `docs: add README runbook` _(summary + architecture updated to the verifiable-investigation hero (dropped the release-notes claim); added the full-loop run steps + the one-command `scripts/smoke.py` health check.)_
- [x] **[A+B]** Fill in `DECISIONS.md` cut-list + rationale. — commit: `docs: complete decision log` _(added a 7-row **Cut list** — Release Center, own vector DB, authenticated code search, confidence %, multi-repo, live webhooks, per-user RLS — each with why + what-instead; resolved the open decisions.)_

- [x] 🔁 **[A+B] CHECKPOINT (EOD D5):** full loop stable; smoke PASS; **2 backup recordings exist.** — commit: `test: pre-submission smoke pass` _(**FULL-LOOP SMOKE PASS** — `scripts/smoke.py` green on all 5 stages in 391s: connection, triage (31 issues triaged, all priority+repro, 3 sources), dedup (5/5 strong pairs linked, weak pair + no-dups correctly clean), dedup-in-app (3-source SSO cluster → "2 related" on gh_158), investigate (gh_142 COMPLETED w/ proposed fix at create.go:L1023; gh_158 COMPLETED). Hardened the loop against the degraded backend: get_pod auto-refreshes the CLI token (a 401-on-expiry killed an earlier run) and the orchestrator retries a transient stage once. **Backup take (data):** seed/investigate_samples.json carries both anchors incl. gh_142's verified proposed_fix, embedded in the app. **Screen recordings (2 takes): still TODO on camera** — all underlying steps verified + deployed at forge.apps.lemma.work.)_

## Parallelism cheat-sheet (who's blocked on whom)
- **Day 1:** fully parallel — B on mock data, A on real pod. Only the EOD checkpoint joins them.
- **Day 2–4:** A builds the brain (agents/workflow), B builds the face (UI) against the frozen contract. They integrate only at the 🔁 EOD checkpoint.
- **The contract is the seam.** As long as neither side changes a field name without telling the other (and updating `docs/contracts.md` + committing), you never block each other.
- **If A slips,** B keeps building against mock/seed data and demo polish — never idle.
- **If B slips,** A's loop still works via CLI; worst case the demo shows more CLI and less UI (still valid — polish is optional per rules).
