"""The ``events`` Table — the audit / evidence trail for every issue.

Each row is one thing that happened to an issue, in order: it was ingested,
the AI triaged it, two reports were linked, an operator changed the priority,
the status moved to resolved. The App renders these as a timeline on the issue
detail view — *more valuable than a generic analytics dashboard* because it shows
the provenance of every decision (who/what, when, and the before→after).

Schema follows ``docs/contracts.md`` §7. Like ``issues`` this is a shared team
table (``enable_rls=False``); the backend auto-materializes ``id`` (we assign our
own), ``created_at`` (the timeline timestamp) and ``updated_at``.
