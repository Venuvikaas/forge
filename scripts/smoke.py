"""Full-loop smoke — the single "does the core loop work" entry point.

Runs the per-stage smokes in dependency order and prints ONE PASS/FAIL, so it can
be run before every demo take and before submission (EXECUTION.md Part 1 §6). Each
stage is an existing, self-contained smoke; this just sequences them and aggregates.

Stages (the product loop, end to end):
  1. connection      — authenticated pod call works               (check_connection)
  2. triage          — every issue has a valid priority + repro    (smoke_triage)
  3. dedup           — known duplicate pairs are linked            (smoke_dedup)
  4. dedup-in-app    — the live data behind the "N related" view   (smoke_app_dedup)
  5. investigate     — cited root-cause hypothesis + proposed fix  (smoke_investigate)

The investigate stage drives two live workflow runs (~2–3 min each on the degraded
backend), so it is the slow one. Use --quick to skip it for a fast pre-demo check
(a recorded backup take already covers the slow-live case), or --only to run a
subset.

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/smoke.py --quick    # skip the slow investigate run
